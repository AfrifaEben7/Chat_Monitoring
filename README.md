# Chat_Monitoring
Uses NLP techniques to dectect suspicion in chat

- Run add-user.py to add users to the chat 
- Run server_app.py  
- Run client_app.py
- Both should be on the same network
- Run Admin.py to check for flaged words if any
- Query.py can be run by the admin to make futher dedections from flagged chats.
